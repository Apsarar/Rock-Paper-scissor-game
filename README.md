# Rock-Paper-scissor-game
This project uses Python to implement the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game throws the player against the computer, which selects options at random. This project is a great way to learn about fundamental programming ideas, such as conditionals, processing user input, and using Python's random library.
